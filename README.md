Write code. Hit compile. Tab into the running application. See your changes updated, running at native speed. Smile as your in-memory data isn't decimated in the process.

This is the dream of Worldsong.

It's a serious experiment, and will change far more frequently than my socks ever do. Feedback, criticism, and pictures of cute bunnies are welcome and encouraged.
