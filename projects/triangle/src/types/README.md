Rust source files in this directory are intended to define structs that represent common patterns of grouped data - for example, a Vertex type.

The all public types in this directory are are accessible via state::types::<TypeName>. Public types in subdirectories are accessible via state::types::<directoryname>::<TypeName>.

Please note that this is compiled into a submodule of State (to speed up compile times), so compile.configs in this directory are ignored.
